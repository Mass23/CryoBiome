# CryoBiome - Code

Here is all the scripts needed to reproduce this study, ordered. Copy the data found on Zenodo in a folder names 'Data/' in the code directory and run the codes one by one. The envs/ folder contains the conda environment required for the different analyses (Phylogenetic part is CryoBiome_phylo.yaml, parts that require DESeq2 need the CryoBiome_deseq2.yaml, and so on).
